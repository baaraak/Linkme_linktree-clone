## What is this and who is it for 🤷‍♀️

This is a showcase product I've built in my spare time. It's a very good example of modern, real-world React codebase.

## Features

- Simple local React state management, without redux, mobx, or similar

## Setting up development environment 🛠

- `git clone https://github.com/baaraak/Linkme_linktree-clone.git`
- Create an empty `.env` file in `/api`, copy `/api/.env.example` contents into it, and fill in your database username and password.
- client `yarn && yarn start`
- client `yarn && yarn dev`
- App should now be running on `http://localhost:3000/`

## What's missing?

There are features missing from this showcase product which should exist in a real product:
